# Engine

The knowledge-base engine, a standalone Python program. It holds the library on disk. It does not depend on the project
workbench except for model calls, which this first slice does not make. The design is in
[`docs/specs/`](../docs/specs/README.md) and the build plan is
[`docs/plans/2026-11-05-first-slice-capture-search-read.md`](../docs/plans/2026-11-05-first-slice-capture-search-read.md).

Only library setup exists so far. Requirements: Python 3.15 (the version the first increment was written and tested with) and no
other package.

## Run the tests

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 -m unittest engine.tests.test_setup
```

## Set up a library

A library has two roots, chosen once: a bulk root for books and an index root for the search index. The owner-only config goes
to `~/.config/knowledge-base/config.json` (mode 600), outside both roots. Set the environment variable `KB_CONFIG_DIR` to use
another folder, as the tests do.

```sh
cd engine
python3 -m kb setup /absolute/path/to/bulk /absolute/path/to/index
python3 -m kb check
```

- `setup` prints `{"library_id": "..."}`. It writes a marker file with the id into the bulk root, records the bulk root's
  device in the config, and creates the index root. Running it again with the same roots changes nothing.
- It refuses, with `refused: <reason>` and exit code 2: a relative path, a symlink in a root's path, the same folder for both
  roots, a bulk root that holds another library's marker, a second library with other roots, and a bulk root on the main disk
  unless you pass `--allow-main-disk`.
- The first setup that creates a library also prints a one-line notice on the error stream that rights and legality are the
  owner's responsibility. The tool does not judge them. A repeated setup, a refusal and `check` print no notice.
- Roots that differ only in letter case count as the same folder. If setup fails part way, it removes the files it wrote, so
  running it again works. A system error such as a permission failure prints `failed: <reason>` and exits with code 1.
- `check` is the guard that runs before any later write. It refuses when the bulk root or index root is not reachable or has
  become a symlink, the marker is missing or holds another id, the bulk root is on a different device than at setup, or it is on
  the main disk and setup did not allow that.
- The config is read only if it is a plain file (never a symlink) owned by you with mode 600, in a directory that others cannot
  write.
